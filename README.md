# Vaadin Framework

*[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) allows you to build modern web apps efficiently in plain Java, without touching low level web technologies.*

This repository contains source code and issue tracking for Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 7, both of which use GWT as the base of client-side implementations. You can find source code and issue tracking for newer, web component based Vaadin versions in [vaadin/platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).

Vaadin 8 includes Vaadin 7 compatibility classes and is supported until February 21, 2022 (extended support will be available for ten years after that).

Vaadin 7 support has already ended, [extended support](https://vaadin.com/support/vaadin-7-extended-maintenance) is available until February 2029.

## Using Vaadin 8 to develop applications
